## One of my favorite quotes:
> "Youth is wasted on the young" -Oscar Wilde

As a young kid, I always remember watching my dad work on the **command line**. From this, my curiosity for programming truly grew.
I remember learning and using basic internet protocol commands like:
```
ipconfig 
ipconfig /renew
ipconfig /release
ping -t
```
to diagnose any internet or connection issues I had. Now that I am a little older, I'm more interested in cybersecurity technologies, 
however, I hope my passion for programming and the knowledge I'll gain from *this* class can propel me into my dream career. 

Currently, some of my hobbies include [snowboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1tjmPn12v8) in the winter, and bowling in the summer.
